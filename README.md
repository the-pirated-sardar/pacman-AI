# CMPT 310 Introduction to AI - Pacman Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed as part of the Introduction to AI course (CMPT 310) at Simon Fraser University (SFU). Each project focuses on optimizing different aspects of the Pacman game using various AI concepts. The code is fully functional, and the original assignment PDFs are available for reference.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Search
In this project, the Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world to reach a particular location and collect food efficiently. General search algorithms are built and applied to Pacman scenarios.

### 2. Multi-Agent Search
This project involves designing agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. The implementation includes both minimax and expectimax search and evaluation function design.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
In this project, value iteration and Q-learning are implemented. Agents are tested first on Gridworld (from class), then applied to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

### 4. Ghostbusters (Tracking)
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts. This project involves using tracking techniques to help Pacman hunt ghosts by tracking their movements through noise and other disturbances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You may need additional libraries such as `numpy`, `pygame`, etc. Install these dependencies using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy pygame
